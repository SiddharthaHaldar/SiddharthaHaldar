## Hello World 👋
My name is Siddhartha (but people usually call me Sid).
If any of the following BUZZ words -
-  Service-Oriented Architecture
-  Scalable
-  Highly Reliable
-  Backend Engineering
-  Micro-services
-  Kubernetes
-  Cloud Native

trigger a sense of **Excitement** in your brain, then you are in luck my friend. <br>
Because I am someone who likes to make those words, **BUZZ**! 🐝 <br>

Historically I have worked as a full-stack developer and a data scientist but I have come to realize that **Distributed Systems** lie at the core of **EVERYTHING** we rely on today. <br>
My fascination with this domain has set me off on an exciting journey of engineering battle-tested systems for time critical applications. <br>
Thus my friend, if you are in need of building **resilient backend systems** that **don't crack under load**, let's talk and see how our symbiosis can make the world better, faster and ultimately **BUZZ**! <br>
